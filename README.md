**Q Why segment customers ???**

Ans - Well, because it is still a very difficult and computationally intensive task to target each customer in unique ways, as well as there would be lots of customers on which similar Marketing strategies and Discount offers would work well. Hence it makes intutive sense to break the customer base into clusters on the basis of how and which offers they react to and then proceed to make targeted strategies.
